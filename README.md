# translation_assignment_no_3
Task was :
Create a Hinglish translation from English text. The text should sound natural and also
convert all the difficult words and phrases in English to Hinglish. This converted text should
be easy to understand for even a non-native Hindi speaker.

We have attached below the statements that are required to be used for this assignment.
1. Definitely share your feedback in the comment section.
2. So even if it's a big video, I will clearly mention all the products.
3. I was waiting for my bag.

   In this project, I have created a Python script that translates English sentences to a mix of Hindi and English (Hinglish). We used a mapping of English words to their Hinglish counterparts and split the input sentences into words. Each word was then translated using the mapping, and the resulting translated words were combined to form the final Hinglish sentence. This script can be used to translate sentences in a Hinglish style, which can be useful for various applications involving multilingual communication.

Key components of the project:
1) hinglish_translation(text): A function that translates English words into Hinglish using a predefined mapping.
2) statements: An array containing the English sentences to be translated.
3) Translation Process: The script iterates through the sentences, translates them into Hinglish using the mapping, and prints the translated sentences.
